✅ Installed Docker on my system.

✅ Logged in to DockerHub using a personal access token.

✅ Created a repository on DockerHub to push my image.

✅ Created a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file for CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

✅ Added DockerHub username and token as secrets in GitHub.

✅ Wrote a workflow to:

Checkout the code

Login to DockerHub

Build the Docker image

Push the image to DockerHub

⚠️ Faced an error because I accidentally pushed the secret in the code.

❌ GitHub blocked the push due to secret scanning protection.

🔧 I will fix this by removing the secret from the code and pushing safely.
The time is over , ill fix all the things.
